<p><strong>Get Back in Time</strong> is an app for the Pebble smart watch.
You can use it to find your way back from your hiking trip, locate your parked car or
just see how far you have traveled from a certain point. Just long-press SELECT on your
Pebble and your target is stored.</p>

<div><a href="http://pblweb.com/appstore/553329021b2b662f5b000069" title="Get Back in Time on the Pebble appstore">
  <img src="http://pblweb.com/badge/553329021b2b662f5b000069/black/large/" />
</a></div>

<p>The app allows you to store any amount of locations, which are pushed into your
personal Pebble Timeline. You can browse your Timeline to find a location you wish
to return to. A menu of 20 most recent locations are also available in your watch.
Press SELECT to see the list of your recent locations.</p>
<p>Your Pebble will show you the heading and distance to your target. It uses the
compass to show you which way to go and colors to indicate whether you're approaching
your target or moving away from it. The target is stored so that you can use other
Pebble apps in the mean time and when you return to Get Back in Time you will see
up-to-date heading and distance to your target.</p>

<p>The app works even if your Pebble doesn't yet have the Timeline functionality.</p>
<div id="troubleshooting">
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Click or tap the items below if they correspond to your situation.</p>
<ul>
 <li>The basics
  <ul>
   <li>The distance is calculated based on the location of your phone.</li>
   <li>If your phone can't get a good GPS signal, your position can't be determined. This may often happen if you are indoors, especially in basements or tunnels where there is no clear visibility to the sky (and the GPS satellites).</li>
   <li>The compass works best if you keep your watch steady and leveled horizontally.</li>
   <li>The accuracy of your location (labeled gps acc.) is shown in the top right hand corner.</li>
   <li>It may take a while to calibrate the compass.</li>
   <li>Magnetic sources interfere with the compass and the compass calibration.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>The arrow jumps or points to incorrect direction
  <ul>
   <li>If you keep your watch in a horizontal or tilted position, the arrow will be jumpy. Try to keep your watch leveled horizontally.</li>
   <li>The compass in your Pebble may be calibrated poorly. If you slowly turn around a full circle and the arrow doesn't point to a single location, you have to recalibrate the compass. You have to reset your Pebble by holding the BACK and SELECT buttons down for about 10 seconds. When the compass is recalibrating, stay away from magnetic sources. (Examples of usual magnetic sources: the charging cable of your Pebble or a Macbook, loudspeakers, fridge.)</li>
   <li>There are magnetic sources nearby. Stay away from power lines, fridges, big electronic appliances etc.</li>
   <li>The magnet in your Pebble's charging cable interferes with the compass. The compass cannot be used when the phone is charging.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>The distance is not changing although I'm moving
  <ul>
   <li>Is your phone moving with you? Your location is based on the location of your phone.</li>
   <li>Open the settings (from the Pebble app in your phone) and set update interval to something else than automatic. (Automatic doesn't work for all iOS devices.)</li>
   <li>If you're using iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) make sure that the Pebble app is allowed to get your location. Go to Settings â†’ Pebble Time (or Pebble, if you're using original Pebble or Pebble Steel) and make sure that the Location setting is set to Always. If your location is still not updating, try to open any maps app on your phone/pad (anything that uses GPS). It seems that iOS is sometimes quite lazy to tell the current location to the Pebble app...</p>
   <li>Is the location accurate enough? If "gps acc." field shows a value greater than 50 (or greater than the distance to your target), your position and distance to your target cannot be determined reliably.</li>
   <li>Does your phone have a clear visibility to the sky?</li>
   <li>If you open any map application on your phone, can you see yourself moving on the map?</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>I can't see the arrow, only a circle
  <ul>
   <li>Your location is not accurate enough for the app to know which way you should go. Anyways, you should be pretty near to your target. Make sure your phone has unobstructed view to the sky and can get a good fix on GPS satellites.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Android App</h2>
<p>To more easily add a location, you can choose your destination with the Google Maps on Android and send it to your Pebble.</p>
<p>After installing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=caller.pebble.mapper">GBIT Map Share for Pebble</a> by Ben Caller,
choose a place in Google Maps on your phone and Share with Pebble Get Back In Time.
Source is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/bcaller/GBIT-map-share-android">@bcaller/GBIT-map-share-android</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="advanced">
<h2>Advanced usage</h2>
<p>You can set targets also using the form below or via an API. Just POST a JSON object
with <tt>position</tt> element in the root level, and a new pin will be pushed to your
Timeline. The object will be pushed to the Pebble Timeline. If you insert a <tt>pin</tt>
element (<a href="http://developer.getpebble.com/guides/timeline/pin-structure/">see
Timeline Pin Structure</a>) to your JSON object, it will be passed on as is. Otherwise
a new pin with some basic properties is created automatically. <tt>Open Watch App</tt>
action is added to all pins.</p>
<h3>Your personal tokens</h3>
<p>You need an account token in order to send locations to the server. In order to push
pins to Pebble's timeline, you also need a timeline token. You can get your personal
tokens from the watch app's configuration page. Open the Pebble app in your phone,
select <tt>SETTINGS</tt> (or the gear icon) for <tt>Get Back in Time</tt> app and scroll
to the end of the configuration screen.</p>

<h3>API usage restrictions</h3>
<p>The API currently runs on a low cost <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
instance and has "best effort" service level. Please test your implementations on your
own environment in order to minimize the load to the API server. If you want a better
service level or if you plan to automatically push more than a dozen locations per day
to your timeline, consider implementing your own API server. You can start by cloning
<a href="https://github.com/samuelmr/pebble-getbackintime">the code on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Show your support</h2>
<p>The Get Back in Time app is provided free of charge. I get no compensation for the
development of the app. In addition, I'm paying
<a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">Heroku</a> $84 per year to keep the server
running 24/7.</p>
<p>If you like the functionality of the app and would like to show your support and
contribute to the server costs, you have three choices:</p>
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" id="subscription">
<h3>Subsrcibe for $1 per year</h3>
<p>Contribute one dollar. This is a yearly subscription. You can cancel any time
you like - and still continue to use the service for free! The payment is strictly
voluntary.</p>
<p> If 84 users pay $1 each year, the current server costs are covered. All additional
funds are used for additional capacity to the server platform - e.g. faster response times
and more data storage.</p>

<h3>Sponsor the developer</h3>
<p>If you like the app (or any of my other Pebble apps) and would like to encourage me
to maintain them and create new apps, you can send a small contribution to my personal
Paypal account samuel@iki.fi (choose the option <em>I'm sending money to family or
friends</em>).</p>
<p>I will use the money for personal recreation, take my family out for a dinner, support
cool projects on Kickstarter or something similar. But most importantly, your kindness
will fill my heart with joy and increase my enthusiasm to create useful and fun apps
for the great Pebble user community.</p>
